Caesar Cipher Implementation
This repository contains a Python implementation of the Caesar Cipher, a simple and widely known encryption technique. The Caesar Cipher shifts each letter in the plaintext by a fixed number of positions down or up the alphabet.

Usage
Encryption:

To encrypt a message, run the script and choose option '1'.
Enter the message you want to encrypt when prompted.
Enter a positive integer as the shift value.
The encrypted message will be displayed.
Decryption:

To decrypt a message, run the script and choose option '2'.
Enter the encrypted message when prompted.
Enter the same positive integer used for encryption as the shift value.
The decrypted message will be displayed.
Example
Suppose we want to encrypt the message "HELLO WORLD" with a shift of 3.

Original Message: HELLO WORLD
Shift: 3
Encrypted Message: KHOOR ZRUOG
To decrypt the encrypted message "KHOOR ZRUOG" back to "HELLO WORLD," we need to use the same shift value of 3.

Notes
Only alphabetic characters will be encrypted or decrypted. Other characters (like numbers, punctuation, etc.) remain unchanged.
The shift value must be a positive integer.
Feel free to use and modify this implementation according to your needs!
